# Source code for uiux.es
[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/89ddfa75-4f92-4463-8840-f710683900d4/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/deeleman-uiux/deploys)

uiux.es is my personal introduction site, built on top of plain-vanilla HTML5 and CSS.

## Building the site for development

Please run `yarn dev` from your terminal console. The site will be mounted using Parcel JS and a lightweight server with change watch features will be spawned.

## Bundling the site for production

Please run `yarn build` from your terminal console. The bundled site will be made available from the `/dist` folder.
